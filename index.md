## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rinriukato/rinirukato.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rinriukato/rinirukato.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Test Header

Test Text: "Hello Ladies and Gentlemen! welcome to episode one of Jermacraft! the series where I play minecraft, this is going to be a single player let's play, and when I say "let's play" I use that term pretty loosely because I am an idiot in this game. You're gonna see lots of fails, your gonna see lots of triumphs, at least I'm hoping, so go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of coco. I got apple cider right here freshly brewed. Let me take a sip, ah that's some good cider!"
